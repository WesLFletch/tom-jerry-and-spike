## Overview

This is a collaborative project by:
- Kiratiya Barrera
- Wesley Fletcher (to whom correspondance should be addressed at weslfletch@gmail.com)
- Daniel Hu
- Shouro Shuvit
- Tanish Thaker

It is a revisit to a class project for STAT-421: Machine Learning at Texas A&M University, to refine and improve upon our past work and showcase it in a intuitive and expandable environment.

We have employed (INSERT STUFF THAT WE'VE USED HERE). All of these resources have been instrumental to the success of our project.

## Quick Start Guide:
